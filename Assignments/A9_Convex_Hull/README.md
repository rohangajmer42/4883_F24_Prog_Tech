Assignment Overview
1. Erect the Fence (LeetCode 587)

This problem is a direct convex hull problem where you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the given points. You can solve it using Graham's Scan or Andrew's Monotone Chain algorithm. It involves determining the outer boundary of a set of points, much like a traditional convex hull problem Solution.

2. The Skyline Problem

This problem involves determining the outline of buildings in a 2D plane. Though not explicitly about convex hulls, it requires similar spatial reasoning and geometric approaches to determine the critical points of the "skyline" formed by overlapping buildings The Skyline solution - LeetCode.

These problems focus on spatial data and are suitable for those looking to practice computational geometry and related topics like convex hulls.
