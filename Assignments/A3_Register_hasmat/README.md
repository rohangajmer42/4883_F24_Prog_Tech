# Hashmat the Brave Warrior - Soldier Difference Calculator

## Project Overview

This C++ program is a solution to the problem where Hashmat, a brave warrior, calculates the difference between the number of soldiers in his army and his opponentâ€™s army. Based on this difference, he decides whether to fight or not. The program reads pairs of soldier counts and outputs the absolute difference between Hashmat's soldiers and his opponent's.

## Problem Statement

Hashmat's soldier count is never greater than his opponent's. Given pairs of numbers representing the soldier count in Hashmat's army and his opponent's army, the task is to compute the absolute difference between the two numbers for each input pair.

### Input

- The input consists of two numbers on each line: 
  - One representing the number of soldiers in Hashmat's army.
  - The other representing the number of soldiers in his opponent's army.
  
- Input is terminated by "End of File" (EOF).
- Each number is less than or equal to \(2^{32}\).

### Output

For each input pair, output the absolute difference between the two numbers on a new line.
