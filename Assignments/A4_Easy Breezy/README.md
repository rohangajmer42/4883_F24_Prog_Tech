LeetCode 128 - Longest Consecutive Sequence. This problem deals with finding sequences, which shares similarities with the idea of cycle lengths in the 3n + 1 problem.

LeetCode 125 - Valid-palindrome, which involves string manipulation. While not exactly the same, students will practice parsing and modifying strings.

LeetCode 67 - add binary, This is a binary representation-related problem. Although it differs slightly, the logic of working with non-standard binary systems overlaps.

LeetCode 2 - Add Two Numbers, which also involves handling addition of large numbers, albeit represented differently.

LeetCode 7 - Reverse Integer is similar in its need to handle and manipulate integers, though the problem context differs slightly.

LeetCode 62 - Unique Paths could be a way to practice with physical movements across grids or paths.

LeetCode 11 - Container With Most Water involves summation techniques applied in a geometric context.

LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 BitsThe logic behind counting actions similar to recursion or iterations

LeetCode 66 - Plus One could help students develop basic arithmetic and comparison skills.

LeetCode 69 - Sqrt(x), as both involve math operations that require approximation techniques.

LeetCode 1523 - Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range. The logic of finding and summing odd numbers between two boundaries is closely related.

LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 Bits, where the goal is to count the number of 1s in the binary form of a number.

LeetCode 221 - Maximal Square, which deals with partitioning or working with grids.

LeetCode 1365 - How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number deals with comparisons and rankings between numbers.

LeetCode 53 - Maximum Subarray has a somewhat similar concept of partitioning space and working with boundaries in a more abstract sense.

LeetCode 9 - Palindrome Number, which also involves manipulating digits and performing checks.

LeetCode 367 - Valid Perfect Square, where number properties and mathematical problem solving are involved.

LeetCode 50 - Pow(x, n), where you calculate powers of numbers.

LeetCode 414 - Third Maximum Number, where the goal is to find the third maximum but can be adapted for second-largest as well.

LeetCode 55 - Jump Game, where you calculate possible jumps based on conditions.

LeetCode 1342: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
Involves simple arithmetic calculations and iterative processes, similar to the physics problem.

LeetCode 794: Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State
This problem involves a mathematical sequence, much like UVa's problem where you work with dynamic sequences.

LeetCode 1281: Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits
While this is a straightforward subtraction problem, this LeetCode problem involves subtraction logic in a basic setting.
