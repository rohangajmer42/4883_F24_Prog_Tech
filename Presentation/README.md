Presentation
There is no set format.
The discussion should last 10-15 minutes with the hopes of an extended discussion.
PPT's are ok but not necessary.
An outline (like a readme of sorts) that details your approach to the problem is sufficient.
What aspects am I looking for when you present?
Explain the problem and how you came to find it / choose it.
Use graphics or any imagery to help explain the problem and solution.
Tell the class what your approach was to solving the problem. This should include:
what problem solving paradigm did you assume the problem was categorized as. (dp, divide n conquer, brute force, backtracking, etc.)
were you correct in you assumption?
did you have roadblocks (places you got stuck)?
what discoveries did you made to get over a roadblock?
discuss any incorrect assumptions you may have made initially.
Discuss your coded solution and any speed ups that you may have discovered.
If you do not have a solution (which is ok!) discuss your current progress and your future plans for solving the problem (even if you don't plan on solving it).
More to come with questions from the class and clarifications from me.
